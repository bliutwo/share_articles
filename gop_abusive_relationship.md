# GOP's Supporters Alleged Abusive Relationship With the GOP

The user `/u/Jackpot777` explains [how the GOP maintains their abusive relationship by grooming their supporters in 8 steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/gh0sgb/pastor_who_often_asked_atheists_hows_that_working/fq61tzz/):

> That's because his supporters are the abused in an abusive relationship. How they groom people in eight steps, and you can substitute politics for religion or for personal relationships. It's what they do, it's who they are. If you're a Republican, this has been your life...
>
> 1 - You've been told that nobody else understands you like they do. For years.
>
> 2 - Everyone else gets badmouthed. It's just the two of you literally against the entire world. And they'll do it so much that things that aren't epithets get used as words to hate everyone else by.
>
> 3 - They'll tell you that, if you left them, all other relationships are just the same as the one you're in (even though you can see other people online talking about how what you're in is a bad relationship and all you have to do is leave them). 'Both sides are the same but I'm better' - eventually, you don't know up from down in what constitutes a healthy or a toxic relationship.
>
> 4 - You're told what to cut out of your life. Music, interests, TV shows, certain movies, even frothy coffee gets badmouthed and cut out because "you don't want to be a 'latte drinker' now do you?" (there's one of those things I mentioned in #2, using things that aren't epithets as one to control you).
>
> 5 - They take your money, claim they'll be great with it, and then spend it on their friends. They'll give you crumbs once in a while. Maybe every four years they'll treat you to a little something nice (that's worth a fraction of what they gave to their friends).
>
> 6 - every problem gets kicked down the road. The problem crops up in the New Year but it wasn't even mentioned in January. "It's going to go away" in February, and anyone that mentions it is just saying fake stuff, baby. Still nothing done in March, but any mention of it is "you're just finding faults with me". Then when April comes and it's clear what the shitstorm looks like, they blame everyone else for saying it wasn't going to be a big deal. Sounds familiar, huh.
>
> 7 - like in any abusive relationship, you're beaten down. You repeat the words in the way they taught you. You repeat the answers. Even though you know of situations where you've come out worse for the way the relationship is, you defend the abuser. First with a fake air of calm, then with a seething rage. And when people offer you a way out, you go right back to the abuse.
>
> 8 - the relationship is so twisted, you so believe everything you're told about what's real and what's not, they will literally put you in situations that could kill you. And you say you're doing it willingly, proudly, but the fact is you're a shell of the idealistic person you used to be. You just got in with the wrong crowd, but it's too late to get out now because people might think less of you. Which is all part of what you were told in #1. Only they understand you...
>
> **EDIT** - thanks for all the great answers from former victims, now survivors, of abuse. You have strength, and now you have their playbook. It wasn't you, it was all them.

> Soon after I received notification that someone had posted this to /r/bestof is when the anger started. Abusers know that abuse is wrong, but they can't control themselves. If they could, they wouldn't be abusers. I've mainly been answering them just with the parts that apply to their posts to me. If they'd stop for a minute and look down the thread they'd see there are two types of answer - the survivors, and the abusers coming up with the same replies again and again that all seem to be from a specific ideology. Looks like this Venn diagram's a circle tonight for the second group. If you see anyone start justifying an answer using a tactic from the list, help a redditor out and answer them back with the parts from my original post that apply to them.

> And thanks for the awards.

> **EDIT 2** - got a reply that was later deleted by a Redditor that would probably claim to be, I don't know, pretty chill. Amongst all the usual stuff (I'm the one abusing for pointing out what abusers do, I'm boneheaded, the others demonize, something about murder, I'm genocidal, even mischaracterizing this whole sub because in their view it "refuses to accept the fact that some people prefer to live in faith systems" instead of actual posts we have like [Pastor Raped His 14-Yr-Old Daughter For 2 Years, Gets Shorter Jail Time For Being "A Man Of God"](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ghlda0/pastor_raped_his_14yrold_daughter_for_2_years/) and [Two ultra-Orthodox bastions account for 37% of Israel's virus deaths](https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/ghig94/two_ultraorthodox_bastions_account_for_37_of/) etc. - oh, we accept you're living this way. That's PART OF WHY WE REJECT IT) they said about Step 2 (the epithets):

> >Things like "alt right". What's alt right? Anyone who disagrees with you. They must be Nazis, or, literally as you have claimed right here, somehow mentally abused. It couldn't possibly be that they just, you know, think you're wrong.
>
> Ah yes, they just disagree with me. They're not Nazis...
>
> [The use of the term "alt right" was coined by American neo-Nazi Richard B. Spencer, as he himself asserts](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/us/alt-right-salutes-donald-trump.html). The poster claims it's what the left uses to attack his ideology - acknowledging that Nazis are a bad thing, [but goes on to say the term that came from a self-proclaimed white supremacist that used the English translation of "Sieg Heil" in a speech to an audience raising their arms in a Nazi salute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o6-bi3jlxk) is what the others do to them. Taking a term put out there by a LITERAL NAZI to say they're not Nazis.

> They claim they're being attacked when they're the ones attacking, using the words they've been taught and claim we did that. It's what an abuser does.

> [If these words weren't worthy enough, and they weren't, then why make them? Why spend all that time constructing a post you yourself know to be weak? Why stand by a philosophy of fear and hate and weakness instead of one of reason and caring and strength?](https://imgur.com/a/D3QJKui)
