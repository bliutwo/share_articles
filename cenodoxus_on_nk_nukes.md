[`/u/Cenodoxus`'s assessment on North Korea's nuclear arsenal](https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/g7o6nm/japanese_media_reports_n_koreas_kim_jong_un_in/foj91bh/) as linked from a [previous post](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11vKR8Sc8NcVCNRYxY9x1dDLeJCxJUFAFGe7h8xQioDg/edit?usp=sharing):

> I actually wouldn't worry too much about NK's nuclear arsenal. In order to be a credible threat, you need a nuke and a reliable delivery system, and NK's always had problems with the latter. It's really, really hard to build a reliable ICBM, and it's also really, really hard to build and maintain the number you'd need to do some real damage, especially without anyone knowing about it. (Also, hot tip for the wannabe dictators out there: It's a bad idea to force political prisoners to wrench on sensitive weapons systems. They are not, shall we say, invested in your success.)

> NK also has a really knotty problem, which is trying to be enough of a threat to get attention, concessions, and aid, but not enough of a threat that China or the U.S. finally decide that East Asia's little shit-talking poodle needs to be stomped. NK using a nuke against one of its perceived enemies would rapidly reclassify it from "Annoying Pest That Bored Hegemon Can Afford to Ignore" to "So You've Decided To Become Part of the Department of Defense Budget: A Handy Guide for People Who've Fucked Themselves."
>
> And one of the more plausible explanations for NK's sudden outreach to South Korea and the States in 2018 is that their September 2017 nuclear tests accidentally destroyed a portion of the Punggye-ri site and killed a bunch of workers and scientists. They were afraid that foreign intelligence services would pick up on it and realize that part of their nuclear program literally collapsed, and they wanted to get out ahead of it.

> That doesn't mean they don't have other sites (they do) and they're not still mucking around with some dangerous stuff (they are), but that kind of failure is also characteristic of NK's efforts.
