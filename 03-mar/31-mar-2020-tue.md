# Highlights from Today's Coronavirus Articles

It is currently **Tuesday, Mar 31 2020 (11:51 AM)**.

Here are some highlights I've compiled from articles (mostly in the past 24 hours) about coronavirus and some comments on them.

## Good news first: "Bend it like the Bay Area: Doctors see flatter curve after 2 weeks of social isolation"

[Original article, Politico](https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/03/30/bend-it-like-the-bay-area-doctors-see-flatter-curve-after-2-weeks-of-social-isolation-1269663)

Notable quote from article:

> State leaders and doctors are **cautiously optimistic** that the **Bay Area's early moves to lock down residents** two weeks ago have **prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region's health care capacity** thus far."

Another notable quote:

> "While officials remain adamant that people **stay home** and adhere to **social-distancing** guidelines — **the Bay Area Monday extended its stay-at-home order to May 1** — they also are **praising residents for following orders** and **expressing optimism that the measures will continue to work**."

## Aerosol properties and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2

[Original article, NIH](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces)

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is stable in aerosols:

> the **stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces** likely contributes to transmission of the virus in healthcare settings

## "CDC considering recommending general public wear face coverings in public"

[Original article, Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/cdc-considering-recommending-general-public-wear-face-coverings-in-public/2020/03/30/6a3e495c-7280-11ea-87da-77a8136c1a6d_story.html?utm_source=reddit.com)

The following quote from the article is **questionable**:

> The droplets are not aerosolized, and thus do not float through a room but rather fall quickly to the floor.

Does this contradict what the [National Institute of Health (NIH)](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-stable-hours-surfaces) said about the aerosol stability of SARS-CoV-2? Here's the quote again:

> the stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces likely contributes to transmission of the virus in healthcare settings.

**It's still a bad idea to suggest that everyone wear medical masks (surgical and N95) because of the PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) shortage:**

> “Given the shortage of PPE available to our healthcare workforce, it is irresponsible for anyone to suggest that we should all don masks, reducing the supply for nurses and physicians who do not have the luxury of treating symptomatic, very sick patients from 6 feet away,” Messaoudi said in an email.

Here's a quote from the article about **another recommendation not to wear masks:**

> Jeffrey Duchin, a top health official in Seattle and King County, Wash., which endured the first widespread outbreak of covid-19 in the United States, said **the health department there does not recommend that people without illness wear a mask, both because the benefit is uncertain and because there’s a shortage of face masks for health-care workers.**

On the other hand, here's a quote from the article about how **regular speech contributes to spread**:

> In recent days a video has been in circulation via YouTube showing anonymous researchers using laser beams in a darkened laboratory to study the way speaking can generate droplets. The researchers urge people to cover their faces to block droplets caused by speech. The video ends with an informal appearance by Harold Varmus, former director of the National Institutes of Health and the National Cancer Institute, who urges people to speak virtually and not face to face.
> 
> “The laser beam experiments demonstrate clearly that **you don’t need to cough or sneeze to produce the fluid droplets that are likely to be a significant source of infectious virus: simple speech is enough to produce them**,” Varmus told The Post.

## "Not wearing masks to protect against coronavirus is a ‘big mistake,’ top Chinese scientist says"

[Original article, ScienceMag](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/not-wearing-masks-protect-against-coronavirus-big-mistake-top-chinese-scientist-says)

> **The big mistake in the U.S. and Europe, in my opinion, is that people aren’t wearing masks.** This virus is transmitted by droplets and close contact. Droplets play a very important role—you’ve got to wear a mask, because when you speak, there are always droplets coming out of your mouth. Many people have asymptomatic or presymptomatic infections. If they are wearing face masks, it can prevent droplets that carry the virus from escaping and infecting others.

-- George Gao, director-general of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
