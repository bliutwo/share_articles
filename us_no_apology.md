> WASHINGTON - Top Homeland Security officials said on Monday they had no intention of pulling back in Portland, Oregon, and defended the federal crackdown on anti-racism protests, including the use of unmarked cars and unidentified officers in camouflage. The Department of Homeland Security sent law enforcement units to Portland to back up the Federal Protective Service responsible for guarding U.S. government facilities after receiving intelligence about planned attacks around July 4, the DHS officials said. Portland Police early on Monday provided details on another tense night between protesters and federal law enforcement in the city, saying federal agents used tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered outside a federal courthouse downtown.

> Apologising would be tantamount to admitting guilt, which they are obviously not going to do.

> Suing them is the obvious next step.

> Beyond that, anything that involves pitting other state police forces or national guard against federal forces just advances the doomsday clock one step further towards civil war, and to be very honest, I'm not all that optimistic that the US isn't heading that way in any case.
