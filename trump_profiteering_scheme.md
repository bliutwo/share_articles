> The Trump administration and the GOP would have us get sick and die while they profit off of tax dollars.

> 1.) Eliminate oversight of the spending of nearly a trillion dollars of tax dollars: https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/490737-stimulus-opens-new-front-in-trumps-oversight-fight
> 
> 2.) Aquire the authority to command which businesses get which contracts: https://youtu.be/MlQx7Qs2ACI
> 
> 3.) Have trusted people stand up companies through which the money can be funneled (3 week old company, founded through a loan approved via the Coronavirus Stimulus bill, is now the center of medical supply distribution): https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/republican-fundraiser-company-coronavirus-152184 "I don't want to overstate, but we probably represent the largest global supply chain for Covid-19 supplies right now," he said. "We are getting ready to fill 100 million-unit mask orders."

> 4.) Have the federal government sell, at a reduced price, it's strategic stockpile to the new companies, run by your buddies: https://twitter.com/DavidBegnaud/status/1245841458323771393

> 5.) Have the states bid on the supplies, driving up the price: https://youtu.be/2zeEUs7tcpE

> 6.) Have the federal government spend taxpayer dollars to ship supplies purchased from China to these brand new private companies: https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/29/823543513/project-airbridge-to-expedite-arrival-of-needed-supplies-white-house-says?utm_campaign=npr&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews

> 7.) Eliminate the competition. Attack any company that doesn't play ball. https://mothership.sg/2020/04/trump-3m-10-million-masks/

> Edit 2: electric boogaloo

> Congress and the Supreme Court aren't going to do shit. Neither is Biden or the DNC. We need another Battle of Athens.
> 
> Fun fact: the position with the highest constitutional power is your county sheriff. They have the ability to block feds from entering and leaving the county. A few did this back during the whole "extraordinary rendition" thing whenever that was.
> 
> **I would pen an email, letter and call to your county sheriff citing sources and your concerns of the feds taking your hospitals supplies. I just thought of this replying to you and I will be doing this tomorrow. We need sheriffs and deputies guarding our hospitals from the feds.**
