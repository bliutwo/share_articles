# A Firsthand COVID-19 Experience

`/u/Cant_Even18` [recounts their harrowing COVID-19 experience in great detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/WhitePeopleTwitter/comments/gidso7/take_your_mask_off_to_make_me_feel_better/fqfvrqn/), in spite of coworkers who think it's all overblown:

> I'm happy to tell you, because the worst part was not knowing if what I was feeling was normal or if each new symptom meant I would die.
>
> TLDR at the bottom.
>
> First, I got an annoying but mild sore throat. It went away in two (2) days. Four (4) days after the initial sore throat, I woke up and coughed once. A sharp, short, dry cough. I never cough. No fever. I said ok, if I cough again I won't go to work. Went to work wearing a mask and distancing, didn't cough again til noon. After the 3rd cough at work, I went home.
>
> In the 15 minutes it took me to get home, I was coughing uncontrollably. My fiance happened to be having a virtual doctor appointment as I walked in. The doctor heard me coughing, asked if we had been exposed. We knew of a few people who had it. Doctor immediately ordered tests for four (4) days later (first available appointment- we were SO lucky to get tested bc no one was getting tested).
>
> I took cough medicine and laid down. I slept for 15 hours. I woke up and couldn't breathe unless I laid on my stomach. I laid on my stomach and didn't get out of bed for days. I lost my sense of taste and smell on day two (2)- food was just texture. I could taste sweet, so Listerine tasted like rock candy. I couldn't smell the litter box.
>
> My lungs *hurt* like I had broken glass and sharp knives stuck in there. I take an inhaler medication, and everytime I took it, the burning pain made me cry. I have a very high tolerance for pain; I've broken several bones and basically just took OTC stuff, but this pain was different. It felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. The breathing was  so difficult, but not in an asthmatic way, no tightening feelings. It was like my lungs just wouldn't inflate. They were so heavy.
>
> I couldn't eat and lost 17 lbs in 14 days. I was so weak walking six (6) feet to the bathroom was excruciating. I couldn't shower for a week straight because I couldn't stand up. At one point, my heart raced for two (2) days straight- like I ran a marathon, but I didn't even get out of bed. That was weird.
>
> My fever spiked everyday around 4pm. Never got above 101 F, and most days it stayed at 99F. I got a fever every day for 12 days straight. Once or twice, the fever wouldn't come til 6pm, and I was crushed because I thought I was getting better.
>
> I threw up once. I definitely was concerned about the toilet paper shortage for reasons I'll let you imagine.
>
> I had body aches, but can't take Tylenol, so mostly I suffered through. I did take an ibuprofen twice, knowing doctors weren't sure it was safe. I was terrified I would make it worse, but the pain in my lungs made it so I couldn't sleep. I decided it might kill me, and I came to terms with it. That was a bad day.
>
> I slept and slept and slept for days. *On my stomach, so I could breathe.* I could sit on the couch for about 20 minutes a day, and then right back to bed.
>
> The day I went to get tested, we drove two (2) hours to the testing site. I had to sit up in the car. The doctor told my fiance if I got any worse, go to the hospital right away. I said that people were dying at the hospital, and I'd rather die at home. Literally, I made that decision. My friend's dad had already died from COVID19, and I knew this was a real possibility.
>
> I clawed at the car window bc my brain was so foggy I couldn't remember how the button on the window worked. I could only breathe if the air was cold, so my windows were never shut. I ended up laying down across the back seat, on my stomach, so I could breathe.
>
> The foggy brain lasted for almost 30 days, long after the COVID19 left. I still have trouble remembering words almost five (5) weeks later. Like, I know what I'm trying to say, but the word won't come. This is slowly going away, and I feel I'm improving.
>
> Also, I had no saliva, no mucus, nothing. I've never been so dry. I drank glass after glass of water, but it was never enough. If you've ever had sun poisoning or heat stroke, kind of like that but even drier.
>
> All of these symptoms were concurrent and lasted almost the entire 14 days.
>
> The worst part was not understanding how the virus worked, and not being able to get answers because it was so new. I was afraid. Afraid of dying, afraid of never seeing my family again. I was weak, in pain, and so angry to have no answers.
>
> I wouldn't want my worst enemy to go through this. I certainly don't want people I care about anywhere near this thing. And I hope I can't get it again, but no one knows for sure. So, that's scary.
>
> I was sick in late March into April, and there's new info coming in every day. Doctors now say people can use ibuprofen if like me they can't do Tylenol, and I'm hearing about how laying on your stomach (the prone position) saves lives in hospitals daily.
>
> Recovery was hard- like hardest thing ever, hard. I didn't really feel better until about 34 days after my first symptoms. No one tested me to go back to work because no one could spare the tests. I was told wait til you don't cough anymore and it's been four (4) consecutive days without a fever. I was afraid I would relapse or contract another opportunistic infection, but I didn't. I barely remember the two (2) weeks I was sick, but I remember my symptoms.
>
>  I'll never forget how it felt.
>
> I gave it 11 days with no fever before I went back to work. Just in case.
>
> Everyone at work is fine, and because I socially distanced/washed hands til they bled during my infectious phase, no one ended up sick bc of me.
>
> I was genuinely worried I might have caused someone else to experience what I did, but thank goodness it didn't happen.
>
> TLDR: COVID 19 SUCKS. Wear a mask and please socially distance. AND WASH YOUR HANDS!
>
> Edit: An apostrophe and spelling
>
> I read this over this morning and wanted to add that if you have COVID19 and aren't sure if you should go to the hospital, err on the side of caution and go. Or call your doctor or local hospital and ask what you should do.
>
> This thing is different for everyone and can kill fast. All of my hospitals were overflowing, and I honestly figured I would get better care at home. If the hospital was empty, I would have gone in a minute- it was that bad.
>
> Thank you for the awards.
