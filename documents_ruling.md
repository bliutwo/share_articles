> “In her ruling, [US District Judge Loretta Preska] said that the public's right to have access to the information carried heavier weight than the ‘annoyance or embarrassment’ to Maxwell.
>
> ‘In the context of this case, especially its allegations of sex trafficking of young girls, **the court finds any minor embarrassment or annoyance resulting from Ms. Maxwell's mostly non-testimony ... is far outweighed by the presumption of public access,’** she said.”
