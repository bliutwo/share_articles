# Judge rules to unseal documents in 2015 case against Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's alleged accomplice

Summary of [original article](https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/23/us/ghislaine-maxwell-jeffrey-epstein/index.html):

> A federal judge ruled on Thursday to publicly release documents that have been kept under seal in a case involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's one-time girlfriend and alleged accomplice. The documents are connected to a 2015 defamation case brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claimed Epstein sexually abused her while she was a minor and that Maxwell aided in the abuse. The case was settled in 2017.
>
> Included in the now unsealed documents are Maxwell's 2016 deposition related to the lawsuit in which she denies knowing if Epstein had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sex. Other documents include emails and depositions by others, including Giuffre and anonymous women who also claim to have been abused by Epstein.

> “In her ruling, [US District Judge Loretta Preska] said that the public's right to have access to the information carried heavier weight than the ‘annoyance or embarrassment’ to Maxwell.
>
> ‘In the context of this case, especially its allegations of sex trafficking of young girls, **the court finds any minor embarrassment or annoyance resulting from Ms. Maxwell's mostly non-testimony ... is far outweighed by the presumption of public access,’** she said.”
