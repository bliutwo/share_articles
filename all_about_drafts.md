# All About Drafts

There are a few points to be made about the draft.

## "Will there be a draft? How to answer your kids' questions about a military draft"

[Original article, USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2020/01/06/military-draft-how-answer-your-kids-questions-draft/2823826001/)

Notable quotes:

> **Who is exempt from selective service?**
>
> **Men who are not between the ages of 18 and 26. That's about it.**
> 
> If you are a permanent resident, regardless of citizenship status, you are expected to register for the selective service, says Winkie.
> 
> But just because you're registered does not mean you will automatically have to serve in the military if a draft is reinstated. 
> 
> "If you have a physical or mental condition that keeps you from serving, that'll be decided after you're drafted," Winkie says. "Same goes for people who are dual nationals. If they decide they don't want to draft Iranian Americans for such a conflict, they'll determine that after they draft you."

And:

> At what age can you no longer be drafted?
> 
> Once you're 26, you're exempt from being drafted ... kind of.
> 
> "There's historical precedent for extending that age," Winkie says before noting that in August 1918, during World War I, the age limit was amended to 45. 
> 
> It's important to note that **just because you're drafted doesn't mean you'll be immediately thrown onto the front lines of the battlefield.**
> 
> **"After someone is drafted, they can claim conscientious objector status, which is basically they say they have religious or moral convictions that do not allow them to serve in war,"** Winkie says.
> 
> He adds that **in previous wars, claiming conscientious objector status allowed people to serve as medics or in other non-combat positions, and in extreme cases have made it so they didn't have to serve in the military at all.**

## Conscientious objector

[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscientious_objector)

Notable quotes:

> A conscientious objector is an "individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform military service"[1] on the grounds of freedom of thought, conscience, or religion.[2]
> 
> In some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative civilian service as a substitute for conscription or military service. Some conscientious objectors consider themselves pacifist, non-interventionist, non-resistant, non-aggressionist, anti-imperialist, antimilitarist or philosophically stateless (not believing in the notion of state).

In the United States:

> There are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the Selective Service System and through the Department of Defense. **The United States recognizes religious and moral objections**, but not selective objections. **Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.**[89]

## "Donald Trump avoided the military draft 5 times, but it wasn't uncommon for young men from influential families to do so during the Vietnam War"

[Original article, Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-avoided-the-military-draft-which-was-common-at-the-time-vietnam-war-2018-12)

Summarizing four bullet points:

> President Donald Trump received military draft deferments five times â€” once for bad feet and four times for college.
>
> Thanks in part to the deferments, he did not serve in Vietnam.
> 
> The president has received criticism for dodging the draft, including from members of Congress. Democratic Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a Purple Heart recipient, once called him "Cadet Bone Spurs."
>
> Like Trump, many other young men from wealthy families found ways to avoid the draft.
