> WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection arm confirmed on Tuesday it has deployed officers from three paramilitary-style units to join a federal crackdown on protests against police violence in Portland, Oregon. CBP, which patrols land borders and operates checkpoints for people arriving at U.S. airports and other transportation hubs, has three specially trained units that have deployed officers to Portland, the official told Reuters. "Donald Trump has no justification for deploying paramilitary troops to the streets of Portland or any other American city," Wyden said.
