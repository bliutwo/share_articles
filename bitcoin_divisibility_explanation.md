# An Attempt at A Short Explanation to the Infinitely Divisible Bitcoin Problem

The underlying problem is this: If the answer is too short and you don't know how credible the author is, you won't be convinced by the answer. However, the longer, more credible text (such as a textbook) is so long that it is unlikely that you will ever read it since you have a busy schedule.

Therefore, I'm going to hand-construct curated answers that are short enough that you will actually read it. Even if you are not convinced, at least you will have the time to read these shorter answers.

Even for this article, you can scan it to save time.

## The Answer

Original post: https://old.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rm74z/is_bitcoin_scarce_or_infinite/

Somebody asks this:

> ### Is bitcoin scarce, or infinite?
> 
> I always hear to different things about bitcoin, which, when considered together, seem contradictory. So I wanted to see what the community thought the real nature of the issue was.
> 
> The first argument is that bitcoin is inherently scarce. There are 24 million (21? I don't know) that can ever exist, and over time the pool of available coins will steadily disappear as they are lost/forgotten/etc.
> 
> But on the other hand, people constantly promote the idea of bitcoin being infinitely divisible and therefore infinitely available, and how having satoshis is as good as having bitcoins. Aside from the fact that a 1:1000 split is a ridiculous trick to pull off in terms of price speculation, isn't it completely arbitrary to think like that? If they're infinitely divisible, then they're not scarce, they're of infinite quantities. Whether one satoshi is worth a millionth of a cent or a dollar.
> 
> I'm just having some troubles with this issue. **It does seem to me like the scarcity will be an issue in terms of currency, but apparently it's not an issue because of divisibility? But that doesn't seem right.**
> 
> I don't have bitcoin but have been interested/skeptical in them for a while. Perhaps if the price steadied out for more than 48 hours I'd like to buy some. Is coinbase the proper US exchange these days? In the past btc-e froze my bank account and I don't like Mt. Gox's issues.
> 
> Thanks for any insight!

One person answers:

> Bitcoin is scarce, not infinite. It is infinitely divisible in theory, which means that there can be an infinite number of units, not infinite value. All of the atomic units will still add up to the same $13 billion market cap, and you will have your share of that market cap as long as you hold bitcoins.
> 
> The reason bitcoins are always available is because of the pricing mechanism, enough holders of bitcions have a price they are willing to sell, so anyone can buy into the protocol no matter how little they contribute. Studying the distribution of bitcoins, the velocity, the price, the suppply, the demand...is Economics.
> 
> It's nice learning real things from the real world. Economics is the study of actors in a system, it's about the choices of human beings, not guessing what Bernanke will do next week (though I concede he *is* a human being).

One person asks in response:

> Right. So.. Which is it? 
> 
> Scarce/plentiful are exclusive terms, aren't they?

**This is the explanation I want you to read**:

> They aren't mutually exclusive because they refer to two very different aspects of the currency. And Bitcoin is not like a normal currency, it has aspects much like gold, can be transmitted like paypal, but is also completely autonomous regarding money supply and distribution.
> 
> Lets be clear first though, Bitcoin are not infinitely divisible, they have extremely high divisibility, but there is a limit, people refer to infinite divisibility in the sense that potentially the code can be modified if necessary to add more divisibility as needed, thus it could become even more divisible, and divisible as much as necessary, but **in essence it is not truly infinite**. Now lets separate scarcity/divisibility so you know exactly how they apply to the Bitcoin system.
> 
> * Scarcity: Like gold, there is only so much of it, Bitcoin is just like gold in this regard. This helps kickstart the economy, it provides a level of certainty when it comes to adoption, and provides incentive for early adoption, scarcity is also a good property of a money, which is what Bitcoin ascribes to be. Since the currency is also completely autonomous, it is fixed, having the discretion to add/remove coins in an automated fashion is impossible to regulate (Satoshi broached this very topic way back) so it is left to the users and free market to gauge it's value and keep them safe/secure. Much like gold.
> 
> * Divisibility: Gold however is not very divisible, but Bitcoin, like digital cash, can be divided down to fractions very easily. 21 million bitcoins is misrepresentative though, in reality there are a maximum of 2,099,999,997,690,000 discrete bitcoin units (aka as a satoshi, named in honour of the creator), or a little over 2 quadrillion Bitcoin units that are available. **It is not infinite, though there is the possibility of adding more precision IOW expanding from 8 decimal places to 10 for example.** This provides space for **economic growth**, since it is impossible to reliably and stably add coins as needed to the Bitcoin economy, the **growth of the Bitcoin economy** is instead transformed as an **increase in value of each user's coins**. Right now 1000 satoshi is essentially worthless, but as the economy grows, and Bitcoins are in more demand, the buying power of each coin will increase, such that those decimal places, though worthless now, can help to **accommodate the increase in value of each coin.** _**Scarcity, therefore doesn't interfere with growth**_ as some naively believe. This is how scarcity of coins and extremely high divisibility of coins *exist together*, they are two different aspects that work in conjunction with each other to create a healthy economy that has incentive to grow in the early stages and space to grow in the latter stages (we are still very much in the early stages atm).
> 
> This makes the Bitcoin network very unique. Traditional economies are top down when is comes to economic growth, IOW as a country's economy becomes stronger the dollar value, or buying power strengthens relative to weaker economies, but here's the gotcha, governments take advantage of this growth by printing more money increasing/decreasing the supply according to the performance of the economy (and often abusing this privilege, which leads to hyperinflation), essentially capturing that growth so that they can take advantage of it while every person holding those dollars sees little of that value increase. This is what we call inflation and banks try to force economic growth through loans and credit. If banks and government managed this responsibly it may be an OK system but history has shown that no government has ever been able to stay their hand to print more money and banks are wholly complicit  enablers.
> 
> Bitcoin however is **bottom up**, when the Bitcoin economy gets stronger, there is **no central authority or oracle to add more coins** to capture that value and use it first, instead that extra buying power goes straight into the pockets of those holding Bitcoins, and every holder gets the same increase in value. **This is why Bitcoins have huge divisibility, it is to ensure that each Bitcoin is able to take advantage of this value increase as the Bitcoin economy gets stronger.**
> 
> This also acts as a huge incentive for every Bitcoin user to help grow the Bitcoin economy because their buying power also grows. Win-win for users.
> 
> Hope that explanation helped clear things up a bit.

In appreciation, one user responds:

> Excellent explanation! Reading it gave me the chills - the good kind.
