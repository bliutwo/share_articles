# MIT's Dr. Lydia Bourouiba's Recent Research on the "Coronavirus Cloud"

Here is her [actual published research in the Journal of the American Medical Association](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763852?appId=scweb).

Here is a [PDF version of that article](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zwmrp5xazMsduPVzYp0RDAdrMnkyDG00/view?usp=sharing).

MythBusters's [Art of the Sneeze](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f4sUNWkq60&feature=youtu.be), which illustrates this very phenomenon.

## Key takeaways

- Healthcare workers may be at an even HIGHER risk for exposure to coronavirus, than previously thought
- Original 6-foot physical distancing measures may not be sufficient
- Masks may be necessary

Because:

- Pathogen-bearing droplets of ALL sizes can travel 23-27 feet
- "[D]roplets that settle along the trajectory can contaminate surfaces-and "residues or droplet nuclei" may "stay suspended in the air for HOURS."

And finally,

- Dr. Bourouiba fears WHO's current guidelines are "overly simplified" and "may limit the effectiveness of the proposed interventions" against coronavirus. "There's an urgency in revising the guidelines currently being given by the WHO and the CDC."

## Dr. Dena Grayson's original tweet thread

Most of the following is ripped straight from [Dr. Dena Grayson's tweet thread](https://twitter.com/DrDenaGrayson/status/1245050039359156232), with some minor formatting modifications:

> MIT's Dr. Lydia Bourouiba warns: "pathogen-bearing droplets of ALL sizes can travel 23-27 feet." She also warns: "droplets that settle along the trajectory can contaminate surfaces-and "residues or droplet nuclei" may "stay suspended in the air for HOURS."

> The rapid international spread of COVID19 suggests (current assumptions) may not accurately reflect what actually occurs w/respiratory emissions, possibly contributing to the ineffectiveness of some procedures used to limit the spread" of coronavirus.
> 
> Dr. Bourouiba, an expert in the dynamics of coughs and sneezes: "A 2020 report from China demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 virus particles could be found **in the ventilation systems** in hospital rooms of patients with COVID19.
> 
> Dr. Bourouiba's research (published in [@JAMA_current](https://twitter.com/JAMA_current?s=20)) strongly suggests:
> 
> - Healthcare workers may be at an even HIGHER risk for exposure to coronavirus, than previously thought
> - 6-foot #PhysicalDistancing may not be sufficient
> - Masks may be necessary
>
> These data strongly suggest that EVERYONE should wear masks outside home, but healthcare workers & people at high-risk for serious COVID19 need them MOST.
> 
> Given the global shortage of masks/other PPE, Trump must invoke the DefenseProductionAct NOW.
