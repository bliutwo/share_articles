> Meanwhile, in a crack in the pavement, a dandelion is vibing just fine

> This always cracks me up (lol), but seriously it's funny how gardeners make this joke. Of all people -  *gardeners*  should understand plant ecological succession.
> 
> The reason dandelions love cracks and gravel and the corner of a pickup truck bed, and roses seem to want this perfect soil is purely because we misunderstand their place. Roses don't  need perfect soil. They just want fungal soil, not the bacterial soil you get with compost.
> 
> Dandelions are a pioneer plant. They are step 1 of ecological succession. They have deep taproots to access nutrients deep below the degraded soils they live on. There are more complex things here like microphagy relationships, but I will leave that out. (Similar relationships allow trees to grow on cliff edges). People hate "weeds" but these are nature's "holy shit!" life rafts. Something got screwed up and soil freaking straight up DIED, and these things germinate because their conditions for germination are met. And they GO. And they HEAL. And they restart evolutionary succession and build nutrient and topsoil. We HATE these things, but that's as stupid as hating paramedics, or jumping out of a plane and hating parachutes. It makes no sense, and it shows how disconnected humans are from the natural world. We don't understand it anymore. /end rant.

> Roses on the other hand are bushes. They don't come around until deserts turn to weed pits which weeds build soil and now grasses grow, grasses build soil and now herbs and flowers grow, they build soils so larger woodier weeds can grow. These then fall down and bacteria (who dominate the soil so far) cannot break apart the lignin in these woodier stalkier weeds and grasses.
> 
> Who breaks apart lignins? Mushrooms. So now mushrooms move in, access to all this free food. They break apart these stalks over years, and multiply in the soil. Woodier and woodier plants now grow  and the grassland converts over to fungal dominant soil, and bushes now grow. You now have brushland. PAUSE.**This is the environment roses want.** It will eventually continue to become more fungally dominated as the roses live and die and mushrooms decompose them, and now trees grow.
> 
> Your garden with manure (bacteria) and compost (bacteria) has soils that resemble an early grassland. This is NOT what roses want. You planting roses in a garden and wondering why "they are picky and die" is like throwing a fish in a tree and wondering why it is so damn picky when birds love living in trees. It's literally that stupid. And it shows how much human connection and knowledge of the natural world has been eroded away.
> 
> You want roses? Take a year or two transitioning your soil into fungal dominance by thick woodchip mulch and MUSHROOMS compost. Heck, amend your soils with king Stropharia mushroom spawn, and then cover those with woodchips. Get free food for the transition time. Plant hardy bushes like currants in the soil for now. And for heavens sake stop bagging all your leaves and putting them at the end of the curb. Shred as many as you can with your lawnmower and shoot them onto your gardens, or even leave them on the grass (but still mow/shred them).  They are fertility! Stop paying money and doing work all to remove natural fertilizer!!
> 
> People think there is a such thing as a green thumb. All we really need for plants to grow is to keep that silly human from mucking around by messing with complex ecosystems and nutrient cycling. 
> 
> Struggling with plants? **Often the correct solution is to remove the human**. Our focus is on the wrong thing. *"What can I do to help this plant?"*. Forget about the plant. Expand your horizon. Extend your timescale. The correct question is: *"What can I do to grow this soil for next year"*? I.e. Stop planting plants, and start protecting soil life. 
> 
> Cover soils, and plant a DIVERSE ecosystem. Maximize photosynthesis. This maximizes the most important thing in the photosynthesis equation: the complex sugars. These sugars are the food for the soil life. The soil life eats, lives, dies and makes nutrient available for the plants. More plants begets more plants. Then stop digging and causing soil microbiology apocalypses.  Stop tilling! The life in the soil is the cheat code, so stop systematically killing it and resetting it every spring. Then let that ecosystem do what it does - grow the shit out of stuff.
> 
> In 2 years, dandelions will struggle to grow in your fungal dominated bed (not their ideal environment any longer), but bushes (like roses) will thrive.
