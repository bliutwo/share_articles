# bliutwo's Daily Article Highlights

This repository contains highlights of and comments on the articles I read--mainly concerning SARS-CoV-2, or the coronavirus.

You can view the highlights by clicking on the folders of the months from which the highlights are made.

The reason I started doing these coronavirus highlights is:

- I'm producing content
- I can just leave it once I'm done with it (instead of feeling like I need to stay updated all day)
- I can share my thoughts with others, and know who knows what I know
